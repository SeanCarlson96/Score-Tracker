## About The Project

Team Tracker is a web application inspired by the desire to check in on multiple sports teams with a single click. The user is able to <strong>add up to 10 teams</strong> across multiple professional sports leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and English Premier League). Whether the team has recently finished a game, or is soon to play, each team's game information will be dsplayed on a card for the user to view.

Team tracker makes use of <strong>LocalStorage</strong> to pre load the users teams of choice each time they visit the site. The user has the ability to remove and add teams to their liking so they always stay up to date regarding their favorite teams state of affairs. Team Tracker features a MongoDB connection that records every team searched, and at what time they are searched.

Site Features:
* Track up to 10 teams simultaneously
* Remove and Add teams freely
* Automatically updated information upon refresh or revisit
* MongoDB connection tracks which teams are searched and when
* NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and English Premier League supported

## Story

Working as a Direct Support Professional helping people with developmental disabilities I met many amazing individuals. In the past 2 years I primarily worked with an individual who is a superfan of multiple sports teams. Each day when I would pick him up from his home, we searched the scores of all of his favorite teams on my phone. This person is obsessive over the exact scores and he will often ask me to check the scores multiple times in a day. I found myself repeatedly searching Google for the scores of the same handful of teams and this inspired me to create a project that could simplify this task.
