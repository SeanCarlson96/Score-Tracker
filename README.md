## The Story

Working as a Direct Support Professional helping people with developmental disabilities I met many amazing individuals. In the past 2 years I primarily worked with an individual who is a superfan of multiple sports teams. Each day when I would pick him up from his home, we searched the scores of all of his favorite teams on my phone. This person is obsessive over the exact scores and he will often ask me to check the scores multiple times in a day. I found myself repeatedly searching Google for the scores of the same handful of teams and this inspired me to create a project that could simplify this task.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
