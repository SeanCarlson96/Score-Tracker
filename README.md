# Team-Tracker

This application allows users to check in on their favorite sports teams.


The Story:

I am currently working as a Direct Support Professional helping people with developmental disabilities. For the past 2 years I have been working with an individual who is a superfan of multiple sports teams. Each day when I pick him up from his home, we search the scores of all of his favorite teams on my phone. My client is obsessive over the exact scores and he will often ask me to check the scores multiple times in a day. I found myself repeatedly searching Google for the scores of the same handful of teams and this inspired me to create a project that could simplify this task.
